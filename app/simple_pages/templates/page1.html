            <p>Git is a free version-control software for working on group project collaboration. It is designed to manage
                all source code history. It keeps a history of commits done by the collaborators, allows for reversing changes, and lets developers
                share code. To do this, each developer has to have Git installed on their local device to collaborate.
                It is among the most widely used tools today in the developer world. Git is not the only version control tool there is but
                it is very well known.

<br> </br>GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories.
                It offers all of Git’s distributed version control system features and has some additional features.
                This includes collaboration functionality like project management, support ticket management,
                and bug tracking. With GitHub, developers are able to share their repositories, access other developers’ repositories,
                and store remote copies of repositories to serve as backups.

            <h2>GitHub Terminology:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Branches:</b> a branch is essentially is a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches. The main branch — the one where all changes eventually get merged back into, and is called master.</li>
                <li><b>Merges:</b> a Git merge will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. In the most frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches. </li>
                <li><b>Commit:</b> a Commit is an individual change to a file, or set of files. When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when. They usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.</li>
                <li><b>Tags:</b> a tag is associated with a commit, so you can use a tag to mark an individual point in your repository's history, including a version number for a release</li>
                <li><b>Repositories:</b> repositories are used to manage your work and collaborate with others. It contains all of the project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.</li>
            </ul>
